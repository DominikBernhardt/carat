   Comments to the output:

   <p>
   In this example, there are two orbits each with 3 maximal
   k-subgroups of a representative of the first affine class.
   They are printed in separate lines ((1) and (2)) because
   the translation lattices for these groups are NOT conjugated
   under the stabilizer of the cocycle of a representative for
   the first affine class.
